name: vehicle-history
description: Retrieve a vehicle history report from a VIN using the CarsXE API. Use this when a user wants to know a car's history — past owners, accidents, title status, odometer readings, or whether it's been in a crash.
---

When the user asks about a vehicle's history, past accidents, title status, or ownership:

1. Call the CarsXE History API:
   ```
   GET https://api.carsxe.com/history?key={CARSXE_API_KEY}&vin={VIN}
   ```
2. Summarize the history report:
   - Number of previous owners
   - Accident / damage records
   - Title status (clean, salvage, rebuilt, lemon)
   - Odometer history
   - Theft records
3. Clearly highlight any red flags (salvage title, accidents, odometer rollback).
4. If the API key is missing, tell the user to set the `CARSXE_API_KEY` environment variable.
